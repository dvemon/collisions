# collisions

simulating the movement and collision of circles in a confined space using basic physics and circle-circle collision theorem

### how to use
interact with the program by holding down the mouse button to draw a circle\
when the mouse button is released, the circle will be added to the simulation

### keybinds
* ```A``` - render lines to show attractions to circles
* ```R``` - reset the screen
* ```ESC``` - exit the program

### prerequisites
you will need to install these modules:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

### to do
* use a 2d vector class
* add some debugging information (fps, circle count)
* add a menu to toggle features and change colours
* add a gif to showcase the program

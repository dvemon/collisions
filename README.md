when the mouse button is released, the circle will be added to the simulation

### keybinds
* ```A``` - render lines to show attractions to circles
* ```R``` - reset the screen
* ```ESC``` - exit the game

### prerequisites
you will need to install these modules:
```sh

* use a 2d vector class
* add some debugging information (fps, circle count)
